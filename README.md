A better way to share links when presenting

## Background
As part of my job, I am on stage a lot and I often need to share short links with developers.
Rather than add them to a PowerPoint (which is impracticle during live coding) or having to zoom in, I thought of a dedicated browser page that I could use that satisfied all of my requirements:

1. It should be EXTREMELY visible -- black text on white background
2. It should be EXTREMELY easy to use -- no fiddling with buttons or options
3. It should be EXTREMELY integrated in my workflow -- the majority of my live coding happens in the browser so a pinned tab was the perfect thing.

The result is **Linkinator**.

A dead easy way to share links/words with a crowd of people!

## How it works

1. Just save the `index.html` somewhere and bookmark it!
2. Open the webpage and write in the input field at the top. Whatever you write will be replicated at the center of the screen
3. If your link includes paths like `bit.ly/hello`, `bit.ly/` will turn gray to emphasize the `hello`.
4. If you want to commit your link to the history, just hit <kbd>Enter</kbg>
5. If you want to clear your history, just type out `clear` or `delete`.
